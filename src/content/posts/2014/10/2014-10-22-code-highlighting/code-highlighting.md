# We should support code highlighting

A blog engine should support code highlighting which is rendered on
server side. We don't have that feature yet. But it should be added
at some point. So:

```javascript

var x = "test";
function toY(a) {
  return a + " " + x;
}
```

will be rendered as a coloured *JavaScript* code at some point.

## Don't forget about Antalya

In [this post](@2014-10-21-hello-world) _(yes I am testing relative link compiling)_ I've posted an image of Antalya. Here it is:

[![Konyaaltı Beach, Antalya](@2014-10-21-hello-world/konyaalti.jpg){big}](@2014-10-21-hello-world/konyaalti.jpg){blank}

![Konyaaltı Beach, Antalya](@2014-10-21-hello-world/konyaalti.jpg){big}

![Konyaaltı Beach, Antalya](@2014-10-21-hello-world/konyaalti.jpg) {a text in brackets!}

TheEnd!
